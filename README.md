# Usage

1. Switch to a new virtual environment.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Use the tool as described in `examples.py`. Note that any file that uses the tool must be present one directory above the `rgpvscrape` package (just like the `example.py` script or you can just edit the `example.py` script).
